# Ministry of Education Digital Humanities Talent Cultivation Project Showcase Website

## Summary
This project is the official showcase website for the **"Digital Humanities Innovation Talent Cultivation Program" by the Department of Applied English at National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology (NKUST)**. 
<br>
During my sophomore year, I was recommended by a professor to take charge of the website’s development and deployment. My responsibilities included frontend design, backend feature development, and server setup and maintenance to ensure stable performance and a smooth user experience.

## Project Overview
The website aims to comprehensively present the program’s results in a digital format. Key features include:
- **Course Introduction**: Detailed descriptions of the course objectives and content.
- **Faculty Profiles**: Introduction of professors and instructors involved in the program.
- **Student Projects**: A showcase of outstanding student work and creative outputs.
- **Digital Tools**: Overview of the digital tools and resources used throughout the course.

## Technical Stack & Deployment
- **Frontend**: Developed a responsive layout using Bootstrap, ensuring compatibility across devices. Enhanced user interactivity with jQuery for DOM manipulation and UI element control.
- **Backend**: Developed using Django to implement business logic and manage data operations.
- **Server Deployment**: Hosted on a university server with Apache, I handled the full deployment pipeline including configuration, testing, and optimization.

This project demonstrates my full-stack capabilities—from design and development to deployment. In particular, I independently managed Apache server configuration, static file handling, and security validation, ensuring the website's high performance and stability.
